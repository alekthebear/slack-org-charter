    "name": "Victor Zhou",
    "manager": "Kumail Jaffer",
    "reason": "Victor is acting as an engineering manager (rick and Jordan Maduro explicitly report to him). Platform engineers (e.g., Gianluca Esposito) explicitly report to the CTO, and Grapevine is CTO\u2011led. Title/discipline alignment and strong communication with Kumail make the CTO, Kumail Jaffer, the most likely manager."

    "name": "Daniel Kim",
    "manager": "Jinen Kamdar",
    "reason": "No explicit signal for Daniel. He is a Product Designer on Grapevine AI; other Grapevine designers (Som Chakrabarti, Aleks Bahdanovich) explicitly report to CPO Jinen Kamdar. Jinen mentions Daniel frequently (31 times), and title/project alignment indicates Design rolls up to Jinen."
  },
  {
    "name": "Panagiotis Atmatzidis",
    "manager": "Aaron Cohen",
    "reason": "Panagiotis is an SRE focused on incidents/infra monitoring, aligning with the Infra team. Explicit manager signals show Infra engineers (e.g., Achilleas Triantafyllou, Quan Li, Ben Greenier, Jared Allard, David Orr) report to Aaron Cohen (Sr Eng Manager, Video & Infra). Panagiotis also mentions Aaron and collaborates heavily with Achilleas, indicating he likely reports into Aaron\u2019s org."

  {
    "name": "Ashley Kalley",
    "manager": "Clint",
    "reason": "Ashley manages Aki Tran (explicit signal), indicating she is a CX lead. Clint is the Customer Success Manager with explicit reports from customer-facing roles (e.g., Teresa Araujo, Morgan Smith), aligning him as the manager over CX/Success. Ashley\u2019s discipline (CX Support, Payments pod) matches Clint\u2019s org, and mention patterns (Ashley mentions Clint more than vice versa) further support this reporting line."
  },
  {
    "name": "Clint",
    "manager": "Jinen Kamdar",
    "reason": "Clint appears to be the GTM/RevOps lead for Payments/Grapevine onboarding and already manages Morgan Smith and PM Teresa Araujo. The most appropriate senior leader to roll up to is the CPO (Jinen) who oversees product/GTM initiatives, breaking the cycle cleanly."

    "name": "Katrina Lopez",
    "manager": "Phillip Wang",
    "reason": "No explicit manager signal for Katrina, but she manages the Technical Recruiter (Christine Valenzuela), confirming she\u2019s a People Ops manager. With no Head/VP of People listed, People Operations typically reports to the CEO in startups. Cross\u2011functional exec mentions support close coordination with leadership; thus Phillip Wang is the most likely manager."
  },
  {
    "name": "Morgan Smith",
    "manager": "Clint",
    "reason": "Explicit manager signal states Morgan Smith reports to Clint (Customer Success Manager) on 2024-11-12, which is the most reliable indicator."

Role and project align with GTM: Growth Marketing Manager working on website and payments funnel overlaps with Morgan Smith (Customer Comms & Education) and Teresa Araujo (Payments PM), both of whom explicitly report to Clint\u2014indicating Clint manages GTM functions. Mentions show Clint references Autumn and Morgan collaborates heavily with Autumn, consistent with being on Clint\u2019s team."
  },
  {
    "name": "Carina",
    "manager": "Ashley Kalley",
    "reason": "Ashley is an established CX support lead (explicit signal: Aki Tran reports to Ashley). Carina\u2019s title and channel activity match Ashley\u2019s CX support domain, and Ashley mentions Carina multiple times, indicating a direct management relationship. Clint appears higher-level CX/Success, but Ashley is the most likely direct manager."
  },
  {
    "name": "Bryan Phelps",
    "manager": "Victor Zhou",
    "reason": "Bryan is a Platform engineer on the Grapevine integration; explicit manager signals show multiple engineers (rick, Jordan Maduro) reporting to Victor Zhou, indicating Victor is the Platform/AI team manager. Bryan\u2019s project alignment matches Victor\u2019s, and their mentions are relatively high and mutual, reinforcing this relationship."

As a Product Designer, he likely reports within Product Design; multiple designers (Som Chakrabarti, Aleks Bahdanovich) explicitly report to CPO Jinen Kamdar, indicating Jinen manages Product Design.

Multiple designers and product roles (Som, Aleks, Sam) explicitly report to CPO Jinen Kamdar, indicating Design rolls up to him. Jinen also mentions Daud frequently, reinforcing a direct relationship. Cross\u2011discipline reporting to an engineering manager (e.g., Evangeline) is unlikely."
  },
  {
    "name": "Karen Ying",
    "manager": "Evangeline Cheng",
    "reason": "No explicit signal for Karen. Her role (Software Engineer) and focus on Grapevine integration match Evangeline Cheng\u2019s team, and multiple Grapevine/Core App engineers (e.g., Alex Budure, Emily Hu, David Rios, giorgi, ryan kauk) explicitly report to Evangeline.
